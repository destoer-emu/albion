emulator written in C++, currently only supports gameboy properly

FRONTENDS
sdl frontend is the most bare bones version not supporting save states
imgui frontend has a built in debugger.
qt has support for save states unlike the sdl build

GBA support is current limited to sdl and imgui and requires a bios
it is still very buggy and only a initial impl of the gba debugger is done
and needs to be refactored
